M Simple Nav
============

This is a pure web version of the M Simple Nav Cordova application (https://github.com/magadanskiuchen/m-simple-nav-cordova).

Currently the application is hosted at http://magadanski.com/mSimpleNav/.

= Usage =
The application allows you search for direction and distance to destination. You can search by Address (uses Google Maps API, so you need internet connection for this part) or directly through GPS coordinates (no internet connectivity necessary).

= Technology Used =
In order to provide you proper distance to your destination your location is needed by the application. This is used on your device only and will not be accessible to anyone else.

For determining the direction of the destination compass sensor information is also required by the application. Again this will be used only on your device within the application and will not be information that can be accessed by somebody else in any way.

= Development =
This is still an early version of the application and bugs may occur. If you run into one you can report it in the Issue Tracker: https://github.com/magadanskiuchen/m-simple-nav/issues. Please make sure to provide detailed information for any circumstances on how you ran into the issue and how to reproduce this.
